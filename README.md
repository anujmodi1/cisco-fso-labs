All lab Docs are in the Docs folder

Instructors
==============
Follow the steps in the Instructor_Setup&Lab_Intro_Activity.md

Check Students have installed the following three tools unless they already have an IDE installed they prefer to work with:

Install Jypyter Notebook
===========================
https://jupyter.org/install

Jupyter Notebook
Install the classic Jupyter Notebook with:
#pip install notebook
To run the notebook:
#jupyter notebook

Install GIT
================
https://github.com/git-guides/install-git

MAC and Linux:
#sudo apt-get install git-all

Students
=========
To participate in the DEVOPS tasks, you will need to be added to the lab git repo.
Please provide the Instructor with your git account so you can be added. Once the Instructor adds you to the git repo, you will receive an invite via the email address associated with your git account.
Please accept the invite.

Day 1
=======
The Instructor provide each student with:
==========================================

1. parameters file - this params file has a temporary SSH Key that is associated with a temporary account with limited git access to the repo - it will allow you to push code to your branch
(originally, we requested each students git account and added them, but this turned out to be confusing as many students did not receive the email or had a hard time setting up their SSH keys to their git accounts). The 
Instructor will provide this the day of the lab. All students parameters files are the same except for the Branch Name


2. thousandeyes gui access - you will receive an invitation via email to the email you used to register for the course. If you did not receive this by the morning of the course please let your instructor know via
the chat channel and alternate email so they may add you to the thouandeyes console.

3. logon user name and git branch (they are the same), and your password via chat.


4. Each Student email will also have been added to the AppDynamics LAB Console. 


Students may use any IDE they like to develop code in their branch for the lab assignments.
Students who do not currently use an IDE can use Python3.x Idle or Download a 30 day free eval of Intellij.

For the Json training portion of the lab, we will be using the Jupyter Notebook. Again Students can use any tool they like.
However, we do not have bandwidth or capacity to support all tools so it is recommended to install the free Jupyter NOtebook to follow along.
