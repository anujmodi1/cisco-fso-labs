**The APPD SAAS Controller is upgraded regularly and when this happens, I get an email, and then I need to uprev the agent versions to match the controller.


Students
=========

Follow Steps under Docs in the Students Folder

Check Students have installed the following three tools unless they already have an IDE installed they prefer to work with:

Please Read "Lab Overview" in the Docs folder.

The Goal of this Lab is to:
============================
#Teach a Devops Way of Working to Cisco Engineers who are transitioning from Legacy Configuration Management Work Methodologies Traditionally used for Land Based Architectures,
to a Devops Model Required in Hybrid Cloud Architectures - Rapid Code Iteration/Development using CI Pipelines and Pipeline Tasks. Incorporating Automation where repetitious work.

#Teach Standard Devops Stack Third Party Integrations
Hashicorp Vault - Integrates to inject variable, parameter, api-key, and other creds into code variables in an automated manner via integration with the CI Pipeline
CI Pipeline Integration - Concourse (Open Source CICD Tool)
AWS Integration 
OCI Build Container Integration/Dockerfiles
Git - ensuring all infra code is maintained in a source code repo

#Teach how to RAPIDLY develop Python Code using a CI Pipeline to the CISCO FSP API stack

#Advanced JSON handling via Python - required to efficiently write code to APIs in general

#API Key Rotation and Securely handling cred handling in code

#How to Use OCI Build Containers to ENABLE your DEVOPS to consisently develop code through your Software Development Lifecyle in REAL TIME
A large volume of Cloud Provider Service Outages are due to inconsistent code being migrated through TEST, DEV, QA, AND PROD. 
We will teach you how to avoid this, and prevent these types of outages by ensuring the code passes in all environments before moving to prod, and all environments use identical OCI build containers

What the lab Delivers to your Organization:
============================================
A 'kick-start' collection of FSP API sdks built on python which YOU AND YOUR LAB MATES are going to develop during the lab 
You may take this 'good-bag' home with you and use in your own Devops Operations.

If you enjoy this lab, you may join the git team and contribute to the ongoing development, improvement of this lab as we continue to add in
more CISCO APIs and well as the ability to call your existing config management tools like ansible, and terraform as you step through your transition to CI and CICD for your
Devops Infrastructure Operations Development with Cisco Products.

You may easily via a plug and play methodology, replace the vault, ci tool or other components with your own infastructure components.


****For Students who want to deploy this lab infrastructure in their own Cloud PRovider Environment -we  provide the entire lab infrastructure deployable via code in a separate git repo****
If after the lab, you would like to spin up this lab infrastructure in your own CP, please request access to the lab_gen repo.

Thank You!
